# Ruleset recipes
Quickstart your use of Repository Rules with prebuilt rulesets ready to import. 

## What is a ruleset?

A ruleset is a named list of rules that applies to a repository. You can create rulesets to control how people can interact with selected branches and tags in a repository. You can control things like who can push commits to a certain branch, or who can delete or rename a tag. For example, you could set up a ruleset for your repository's feature branch that requires signed commits and blocks force pushes for all users except repository administrators.
